These codes run into the Google Colaboratory enviroment.

Please pay attention to:

    -  "PATH/IN/GDRIVE/TO/pwdb_data.mat" 
    - signals_path  = "/path/to/Pulse_Wave_Database/Dataset/pwdb_data.mat"
    - root_path = "path/to/root"
    - plot_path = root_path+"figures/"

and adjust it to your corresponding local or Gdrive path.
